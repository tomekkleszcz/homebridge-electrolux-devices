## üêõ Known issues

### Air conditioners

When air conditioner is set to Auto mode the maximum range value is set to 32, and the target temperature is set by changing minimum range value. If someone knows how to disable the temperature range in Auto mode, and allow to set the target temperature the same way as in Cool and Heat mode the PR will be more than welcome. :)
